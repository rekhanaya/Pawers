According to data from Pet Fair SEAsia, 72% of Indonesian households own pets, with cats being the most popular choice at 47%. However, novice cat owners often struggle to recognize signs of illness in their pets. This application is specifically designed to help beginner cat enthusiasts detect diseases in their cats through modern technology.
The project aims to detect cat diseases using artificial intelligence technology. This application employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of cat skin disease images, optimized with MobileNetV2 to ensure smooth operation on mobile devices. For other diseases that cannot be detected through images, the application uses a custom Vertex AI chatbot based on structured data provided to the model.
Key features of the application include skin disease classification through computer vision, detection of other diseases via the chatbot, and additional information on care tips, prevention, and nearby pet shops. The application achieved a validation accuracy of 80% in detecting cat skin diseases, which is considered reliable for initial use.
This application aims to improve cat ownersâ€™ awareness in recognizing diseases early and reducing the risk of delayed treatment. Future development plans include adding more features and enhancing accuracy.
